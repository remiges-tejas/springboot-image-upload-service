# Image Upload Feature Implementation

This project demonstrates various approaches to implementing an **Image Upload Feature** in a Spring Boot application. It covers techniques such as uploading images to local storage, storing them in a PostgreSQL database, and leveraging third-party cloud services like Cloudinary.

## 📜 Overview

The primary objective of this project is to explore and implement robust and scalable solutions for image upload functionality in a real-world application. The feature is designed to provide flexibility and compatibility with different storage backends while ensuring simplicity and maintainability of the codebase.

## ✨ Features

### 1. **Upload Image to Local Folder**

- **Description**:  
  Store the uploaded image directly on the server's local file system.
- **Use Case**:  
  Best suited for lightweight applications or environments with minimal storage requirements.

### 2. **Upload Image and Store in PostgreSQL Database**

- **Description**:  
  Save image data (in binary format) directly into a PostgreSQL database.
- **Use Case**:  
  Useful for scenarios where maintaining image data alongside metadata in the database is essential.

### 3. **Upload Image to Cloudinary**

- **Description**:  
  Leverage **Cloudinary**, a third-party cloud service, to store and retrieve images efficiently.
- **Use Case**:  
  Ideal for production-grade applications requiring scalability, performance, and built-in image processing.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

### **Backend Framework**

- **Spring Boot**: Handles the server-side logic, REST APIs, and integration with storage systems.

### **Third-Party Service**

- **Cloudinary**: Used for cloud-based image upload and management.

### **Database**

- **PostgreSQL**: Stores image data (binary format) and related metadata for image management.

### **Programming Language**

- **Java**: Core programming language used for implementing the feature.

## 🚀 How It Works

1. **Local Upload**:

   - Uploads the image to a predefined directory in the server’s file system.
   - Ensures easy access and retrieval for lightweight applications.

2. **Database Upload**:

   - Converts the uploaded image into binary data and stores it in a PostgreSQL database.
   - Facilitates metadata handling and integration with database queries.

3. **Cloudinary Upload**:
   - Integrates the application with the Cloudinary service using API credentials.
   - Uploads the image, retrieves a publicly accessible URL, and optionally stores the image's public ID for further operations.
